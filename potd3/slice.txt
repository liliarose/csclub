Problem Statement — Slicing arrays:

Define an operation called a slice that reduces all elements of a given positive integer array by the minimum element in that array. Any element that becomes 0 after the slice is removed from the array.

For instance, slicing the array {1, 5, 3, 3, 2} once gives the array: {4, 2, 2, 1}

since each element in the array has been reduced by the minimum (1), and the element that became 0 after subtraction was removed.

Find the number of slices necessary to remove all elements from the array.


Input format:

N (number of integers in following array)
Arr (List of positive integers separated by a space)

Input Example:

5
1 5 3 3 2

Output Format:

S (number of slices needed to eliminate all elements)

Output Example:

4

As always, read from standard in and write to standard out. Don’t forget a new line after output!


Constraints

Beginner Sample Size: N (input array size) <= 1000
Advanced Sample Size: N (input array size) <= 105000
