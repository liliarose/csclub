Area Under a Histogram

Today we just gave a lecture on data structures. Think you mastered them? Let’s see.

From statistics class, you remember how we always worked with histograms. You also remember that for 
histograms, each bar is of equal width, one unit.

Your task is to find a rectangle that fits under this histogram and maximize its area. Find this 
maximum area.

Example:
There are 3 rectangles in this histogram: of heights 5, 7, and 1. The largest rectangular area is boxed
in red, it has an area of 5 * 2 = 10. Be careful with integer overflow

Input Format:
An integer N, which is the number of rectangles (1 <= N <= 100,000)
The next N lines will be the respective heights of the rectangles, the rectangles are given in 
order from left to right: Each rectangle is represented by a height H (1 <= H <= 100,000).

Output Format:
One number: the largest area (don’t forget a new line!) 

Sample Input:
3
5
7
1

Sample Output:
10
